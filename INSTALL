Install pytopo on your local machine with
    python setup.py install
(you'll need Python's setuptools package).

Or get it from PyPI:
    pip install pytopo

Install from the development directory to a virtualenv:
    pip install .

Either way, the executables will be called pytopo and ellie.
On its first run it will create the configuration file it needs.

Developers: To run from the development directory
    pip install -e .
or
    setup.py develop

Or you can run pytopo from the development directory by running
pytopo/MapViewer.py, as long as your PYTHONPATH points to somewhere
where Python can import the pytopo module.

Run ellie from pytopo/trackstats.py -- though right now ellie is
untested because there's a fatal matplotlib bug getting in the way.

Build the API documentation with:
  cd docs/sphinxdoc/
  make html
or
  python setup.py build_sphinx

Requires python-sphinx (or python3-sphinx) and m2r.
