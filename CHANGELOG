2017-03-07  Akkana Peck <akkana@shallowsky.com>

	* Allow resizing below the original size.

2016-08-19  Akkana Peck <akkana@shallowsky.com>

2011-05-07  Akkana Peck <akkana@shallowsky.com>

	0.9:

2005-04-04  Akkana Peck <akkana@shallowsky.com>
	0.1:
	* Coordinate handling routines mostly working.
	* Store coordinates of center, not edge, so zoom works.
